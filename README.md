# How to use this template
## Install all npm packages:

`npm install`

## Run development server
`npm start`

This will start a webpack server on http://localhost:8084/

## Create an optimised production build:
`npm run build`

This will create an optimised build of your project and place it inside the **`build/`** folder

## Other notes
This template comes with **jQuery** and **Bootstrap** integrated by default. You can disable these by editing **`src/js/app.js`** and removing the respective imports.

Happy coding!
